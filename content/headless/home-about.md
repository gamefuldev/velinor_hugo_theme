At Velinor Capital, risk management is not a reactive function - it is the foundation of our investment philosophy. We operate under the principle that capital preservation is the prerequisite for compounding.

Our proprietary trading strategies are built with a low-volatility mandate, employing algorithmic safeguards, dynamic position sizing, and rigorous stress-testing across multiple market regimes.

We avoid directional bets and speculative exposures, focusing instead on statistically robust, liquidity-aware systems that prioritize downside protection.

Every trade we place is governed by pre-defined risk thresholds, scenario modeling, and a continuous evaluation of tail risks â€” ensuring that investor capital is always protected, even in the most turbulent crypto environments.
